Welcome!
This is a website on nature and for nature enthusiasts. It is to appreciate the beautiful landscapes and wildlife that nature has to offer. 
The nature images used are the focal point of the webpage and gives a connection to the natural world. The website design is
simple so as to enhance the user experience. The users can focus on the content without distractions such as ads. The green colour palette 
compliments to the theme of nature and creates a calming effect. The natural sounds audio gives the user the feeling of being outdoors 
in nature, and the youtube video gives the user a glimpse of the African nature and wild animals.

Challenges
1. A challenge I encountered was ensuring the content, images and videos adapt well to different screen sizes. To overcome this, I used the
   <meta> tag to automatically resize the content to make it look good on all devices. I also included some internal CSS techniques like
   width:100%; to make the images and videos responsive.
2. Another challenge was to embed external content, due to some cross-origin restrictions. This was overcome by ensuring that the external
   content sources allowed embedding using <iframe> attributes and HTTPS URLs.
